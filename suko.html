            <p style="font-size: x-large;">Suko possesses a cunning and opportunistic personality, as demonstrated by his initial attempt to deceive Kong by appearing harmless and then biting his hand when the opportunity arose during the ambush. Although easily defeated by Kong in their fight, Suko's intelligence shines through as he subtly directs Kong's attention to the fleeing ape, signaling that he was not involved in the attack.

                Despite his initial reluctance, Suko gradually forms a bond with Kong, aided by Kong's acts of goodwill and attempts at friendship. Suko's survival instincts drive him to accept the food Kong offers, leading to a growing trust between them. Over time, Suko becomes fiercely loyal to Kong, warning him against interfering and protecting him from potential threats.
                
                When Suko witnesses Kong in trouble, his loyalty is put into action, as he employs his resourcefulness to support Kong and have his back against their enemies. Suko's character evolves from a deceptive opportunist to a trusted ally, willing to go to great lengths to ensure Kong's safety and well-being.
                
                Origins
                Not much is known about Suko's origins, though he was a young member of the Great Apes who lived in the Hollow Earth's "subterranean realm" under the vicious rule of the Skar King. The novelization indicated that Suko was one of Skar King's offspring.
